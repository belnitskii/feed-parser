ðŸ“° Feed Parser Bot

A Telegram bot that aggregates articles from RSS feeds, evaluates their relevance based on a set of weighted keywords, and displays the top 5 posts to the user. The evaluation is performed through text lemmatization and score calculation. All articles are cached, allowing the bot to respond quickly without re-analyzing content on each request.

Users can rate articles (like / dislike / neutral) and optionally save them to Instapaper â€” a service for reading saved content across devices. Rated articles are excluded from future recommendations.

ðŸš€ How to run the bot

    Specify your configuration in the application.properties file:

        Instapaper email and password

        Telegram bot token and name

        Your Telegram ID

    Add the desired RSS feed URLs to the FeedSources class.

    Build and run the project:

mvn clean package -DskipTests
nohup java -jar target/feed-parser-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar > app.log 2>&1 &
